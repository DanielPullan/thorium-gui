# thorium-gui

Thorium-gui is a (very) work-in-progress gui for Thorium.

For it to work, you will need AHK installed, as well as PuTTY in the same folder as thorium-gui.

There is an much earlier version in use at PHS, but it was targeted towards managing Raspberry Pi's, whereas this version is more for managing install at a time at G&W.
